    "description": "The cave is about to fill up with lava! Which valves should we open to reduce pressure, and how much pressure will that release? (by FAR my slowest code yet, ouch. Could be optimised by: 1. compressing graph into just start & valves with flow > 0; 2. pre-finding the shortest paths between nodes using e.g. Djikstra's and storing this as a mapping; 3. guesstimating best path and running first; 4. brute force between all remaining paths, using some sort of permutation iterator; 5. pre-culling all paths that can't possibly be better than the current best (if this helps? may do for part 2); 6. using lookup table of how much flow a given valve will contribute given different opening times; 7. pre-culling paths that can't possibly visit as many nodes as the current best did; 8. using BFS and culling all potential routes that are invalid even in best case.)",
